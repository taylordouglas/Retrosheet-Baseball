# Retrosheet-Baseball
Ingestion and Transformation of Retrosheet data to build Baseball Database
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a pet project I worked on over the course of a few months in 2019.

The initial goal was to bring in a few years of retrosheet data to throw into a scikit learn model or a PBI report. It turned into me trying to automate the ingestion of data (RetrieveRetrosheet) and transformation of that data into a warehouse like structure (via sql). While most of the project is ugly (and it isn't quite finished from end-to-end), It was a tremendous learning experience that prepared me for an actual Warehousing project that I worked on Sep-2019 through Apr-2020.

I'm happy to answer any questions (and admit to any accusations of poor code) at taylor.douglas03@gmail.com

Thanks for reading!
